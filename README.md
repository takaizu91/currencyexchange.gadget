How to Install

Method 1 -
Simply get the stable version from this website
http://shinkucast.web.fc2.com/

Just double click the file you downloaded and it will be install automatically to your computer


Method 2 - 
If you decide to pull from git, pull from master branch and .zip them with whatever zip software you have (winZip, 7Zip, PeaZip etc.). Then, change the file extension .zip to .gadget. Images and files needed can be obtain from website in above method.

* By default, most Windows version (Vista or later) hide known file extention. To enable it, click My Computer, then click 'Organize' tab -> 'Folder and Search Option'. Under 'Advanced Setting' in 'View' tab, unselect 'Hide extensions for known file types' and click 'OK'. This should enable you to see the .zip extension and properly rename it.

* Currrently only support up to 27 known currencies as I pull exchangerates from BNM (http://www.bnm.gov.my/?tpl=exchangerates), will update with latest exchange rate once I found other exchange rate sites that give the same access as BNM or easier

* You can test this, use this and distribute it as long as you didn't charge real money for it which would be illegal to Open Source License, do read it for further details.
